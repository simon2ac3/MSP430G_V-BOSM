# MSP430G_V-BOSM
This is the very first project in my first repository. I started creating a vehicle based on stepper motors (V-BOSM acronym). I do not know exactly at this moment what are project objectives. It probably will be changing along the time. I treat it as a fun. I would like to keep my project in the organized shape and under version controlled. Moreover I would appreciate any feedback I could get from the GitHub community.

Project is based on popular TIs' Launchpad with MSP430G2553 on the board. Actually first requirements are:

1) Finishing the main loop on button and stop the uC's program executing.
2) Possibillity to control 2 bipolar stepper motors using 2 L293DNE drivers (each for the one motor):
  a) Controlled speed,
  b) Controlled direction,
  c) Actions like single-step and continuous-mode on each motor separately.
3) Testing the vehicle on simple hardcoded track.
